# Product Requirements Document (PRD) Template

## 1. Document Information
- **Product Name**: Audio Transcription Microservice
- **Version**: 1.1
- **Date**: October 17, 2025
- **Author**: Grok 4
- **Stakeholders**: Development team, API consumers (e.g., software engineers, AI/ML applications), operations team

## 2. Executive Summary
This product is a web-based microservice designed to transcribe audio files stored in AWS S3 buckets. It accepts requests specifying an input S3 path for the audio file, performs the transcription using an existing Python implementation, and saves the resulting transcription text back to a specified S3 path. The service supports concurrent processing of multiple transcription requests to ensure scalability and efficiency. Upon submission, the service returns a unique job ID for tracking. Users can query job status (e.g., processing, completed, failed) with short-term tracking (no persistence beyond 24 hours). Users can configure notifications for job completion, either through webhooks (HTTP callbacks) or integration with Consul for event-based notifications. The service must register with Consul, either via the orchestration platform or internally. It will use a worker management system like uWSGI for handling requests and be deployed as a complete Dockerized container, including a health endpoint for monitoring. Built in Python, this microservice aims to provide a reliable, asynchronous transcription solution for applications requiring speech-to-text capabilities.

## 3. Problem Statement
Many applications, such as voice assistants, podcast platforms, or customer service tools, require transcribing audio files into text. However, handling large audio files, managing concurrent requests from multiple users, tracking job status, and ensuring notifications upon completion can be challenging. Existing solutions often lack seamless integration with cloud storage like AWS S3, leading to manual workflows, delays, or scalability issues. This results in user pain points like long wait times, resource inefficiencies, and missed integrations in automated pipelines. The microservice addresses these by providing a dedicated, scalable API that automates transcription with S3 I/O, job tracking, and flexible notification mechanisms.

## 4. Goals and Objectives
- **Business Goals**: 
  - Reduce processing time for audio transcriptions by enabling concurrent handling.
  - Integrate seamlessly with cloud infrastructure to minimize operational overhead.
  - Provide a reusable service that can be adopted across multiple projects or teams.
- **User Goals**: 
  - Submit transcription jobs easily via API without blocking the caller, receiving a job ID immediately.
  - Query job status to monitor progress (processing, completed, failed).
  - Receive reliable notifications upon job completion to trigger downstream processes.
  - Ensure transcribed results are securely stored and accessible in S3.
- **Success Metrics**: 
  - Throughput: Handle at least 10 concurrent requests with <5% failure rate.
  - Latency: Average job completion time under 5 minutes for 10-minute audio files.
  - Uptime: 99.9% availability.
  - User adoption: Measured by API request volume and feedback surveys.

## 5. Target Audience

  - Developer Persona: A software engineer, aged 25-40, experienced in API integrations, needs quick transcription for app features like voice notes. Pain points: Manual uploads/downloads, lack of concurrency.
  - Ops Engineer Persona: Infrastructure specialist, focuses on scalability, requires monitoring and notification integrations for production workflows.
  - AI Researcher Persona: Works with large datasets, needs batch processing of audio files with reliable outputs.
- **Market Segments**: 
  - Cloud-based applications using AWS services.
  - AI/ML pipelines in media, healthcare, or education sectors.
  - Open-source or enterprise tools requiring extensible transcription capabilities.

## 6. Functional Requirements
### 6.1 Core Features
- **Job Submission API**: A RESTful endpoint (e.g., POST /transcribe) to accept requests with input S3 path, output S3 path, audio format (if needed), and notification configuration. Upon successful submission, return a unique job ID to the caller for tracking.
- **Audio Retrieval**: Download the audio file from the specified S3 path using AWS credentials.
- **Transcription Processing**: Utilize the existing Python implementation (from https://github.com/geraldthewes/multistep-transcriber/blob/main/mst/steps/transcription.py) to perform speech-to-text transcription.
- **Result Storage**: Upload the transcription output (e.g., JSON or text file with timestamps) to the specified S3 path.
- **Job Tracking**: Maintain minimal short-term tracking of jobs (e.g., in-memory or temporary storage) for statuses such as processing, completed, or failed. No need to persist data beyond 24 hours.
- **Notification System**: Upon completion, send notifications via:
  - Webhooks: HTTP POST to a user-provided URL with job status and details.
  - Consul: Publish an event or update a key-value store in Consul for polling/watching.
- **Status Query API**: Endpoint (e.g., GET /status/{job_id}) to check job progress, returning statuses like "processing", "completed", or "failed" along with any relevant details (e.g., error messages for failures).
- **Health Endpoint**: Endpoint (e.g., GET /health) to provide service health status for monitoring purposes (e.g., returns 200 OK if healthy).
- **Error Handling**: Return meaningful error codes and logs for issues like invalid S3 paths or transcription failures.

### 6.2 User Stories
- As a developer, I want to submit an S3 audio path via API so that the service transcribes it asynchronously and returns a job ID immediately.
- As a developer, I want to query the status of a job using its ID so that I can check if it's processing, completed, or failed.
- As a developer, I want to specify a webhook URL in the request so that I receive a callback when transcription is complete.
- As an ops engineer, I want to use Consul for notifications so that I can integrate with existing service discovery tools.
- As an ops engineer, I want a health endpoint so that I can monitor the service's availability.
- As an AI researcher, I want the service to handle multiple concurrent requests so that I can process batch jobs efficiently.
- As a user, I want to query job status so that I can monitor progress without polling excessively.

### 6.3 Use Cases
- **Submit Transcription Job**:
  - Preconditions: Valid AWS credentials, accessible S3 paths.
  - Steps: 
    1. User sends POST request with input/output S3 paths and notification config.
    2. Service validates request, assigns a unique job ID, queues the job, and returns the ID.
    3. Service downloads audio, transcribes, uploads results.
    4. Service updates job status and sends notification.
  - Postconditions: Transcription saved in S3, notification delivered, job status updated.
- **Handle Concurrent Requests**:
  - Preconditions: Multiple incoming requests.
  - Steps: Use async processing to parallelize downloads, transcriptions, and uploads.
  - Postconditions: All jobs complete without interference.
- **Notification via Webhook**:
  - Preconditions: Job completes.
  - Steps: POST to provided URL with payload (job_id, status, output_path).
  - Postconditions: Caller receives update.
- **Query Job Status**:
  - Preconditions: Valid job ID.
  - Steps: User sends GET request with job_id; service retrieves and returns current status (processing, completed, failed).
  - Postconditions: User informed of job state.

## 7. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: Response time for job submission <1 second; support 10+ concurrent transcriptions with minimal latency increase.
- **Scalability**: Designed for horizontal scaling (e.g., via containerization with Docker/Kubernetes).
- **Security**: API authentication via API keys or JWT; secure S3 access with IAM roles; encrypt data in transit (HTTPS).
- **Usability**: Clear API documentation (e.g., OpenAPI/Swagger); intuitive error messages.
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime; automatic retries for S3 operations; logging and monitoring integration (e.g., Prometheus); health endpoint for liveness checks.
- **Compatibility**: Supports common audio formats (MP3, WAV); runs on Python 3.8+; compatible with AWS S3 regions.

## 8. Technical Considerations
- **Architecture**: RESTful web server (e.g., FastAPI) with asynchronous task queue (e.g., Celery with Redis broker) for concurrency. Use a worker management system like uWSGI to handle multiple processes/threads efficiently.
- **Integrations**: AWS S3 via boto3; Consul for event publishing and service registration (register the service with Consul either via the orchestration platform or implement registration logic within the service); HTTP client for webhooks.
- **Data Requirements**: Store temporary audio files locally or in memory; output as JSON/text; comply with data privacy (no long-term storage). Job tracking data stored temporarily (e.g., in Redis) with expiration after 24 hours.
- **Technologies**: Python 3; FastAPI; boto3; uWSGI; Existing transcription library/code; Optional: Consul client library.
- **Deployment**: The service must be packaged as a complete Dockerized container for easy deployment and orchestration.

## 9. Assumptions and Dependencies
- **Assumptions**: Audio files are in supported formats; AWS credentials are provided securely; Transcription implementation handles various languages/accents; Consul is available in the deployment environment.
- **Dependencies**: AWS S3 service; Consul (if used for notifications and registration); External transcription dependencies from the existing repo; Docker for containerization.

## 10. Risks and Mitigations
- Risk 1: High concurrency overwhelming resources - Mitigation: Implement rate limiting, auto-scaling, and use uWSGI for worker management.
- Risk 2: Transcription accuracy issues - Mitigation: Rely on tested existing implementation; provide options for model selection if available.
- Risk 3: Notification failures (e.g., webhook downtime) - Mitigation: Retry mechanism and fallback logging.
- Risk 4: S3 access errors - Mitigation: Robust error handling and validation.
- Risk 5: Job tracking data loss - Mitigation: Use reliable in-memory storage with short TTL (24 hours).
