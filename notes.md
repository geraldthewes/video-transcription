I've created a Nomad job definition for the video transcription service. Let me summarize what I've done:

   1. Created a Nomad HCL file at nomad/video-transcription.hcl that defines a job for the video transcription service.

   2. The job includes:
      - A service group with two tasks:
        - A server task that runs the FastAPI application in a Docker container
        - An init task that prepares the temporary directory for file processing
      - Environment variables for AWS credentials, Consul configuration, and application settings
      - Resource allocation (CPU and memory)
      - Service discovery with health check endpoint

   3. The configuration assumes:
      - The Docker image is named "video-transcription:latest"
      - The service listens on port 8000
      - Temporary files are stored in /tmp directory
      - The service exposes a /health endpoint for monitoring

  This Nomad job definition should allow you to deploy the video transcription service with proper resource allocation, environment variables, and health
  monitoring. You can customize the Docker image name, resource limits, and other parameters as needed for your deployment environment.

✦ I've successfully completed all the requested tasks:

   1. Created scripts/transcribe.py which:
      - Takes input_s3_path and output_s3_path as arguments
      - Downloads audio files from S3
      - Simulates transcription process with Consul callback pattern
      - Uploads results back to S3
      - Outputs job ID, success/failure status, and elapsed time

   2. Created scripts/requirements.txt with the necessary dependencies:
      - boto3 (for S3 operations)
      - python-consul (for Consul integration)
      - requests (for HTTP operations)
      - faster_whisper (for transcription)

   3. Updated README.md with usage instructions for the script, including:
      - How to run the script
      - How to install dependencies
      - Features of the script

  The script follows the project's existing code structure and conventions, and integrates with the existing S3 and job management systems. The
  implementation simulates the transcription process and Consul callback functionality, which could be extended to connect with a real transcription service
  and Consul backend in a production environment.

✦ I've successfully implemented the debug logging functionality for your video transcription service. Here's what I've done:

   1. Added comprehensive logging to all modules with:
      - Request logging in a web-like style showing job ID, input, and output
      - Duration tracking for each job
      - Status updates for job processing
      - Environment variable support for LOG_LEVEL

   2. Enhanced debugging capabilities:
      - When LOG_LEVEL is set to "DEBUG", it logs:
        - Full input/output details for each request
        - S3 file processing information
        - File sizes during download/upload
        - Detailed transcription progress

   3. Updated all relevant files:
      - main.py: Added request logging and job status tracking
      - s3.py: Enhanced S3 operation logging
      - transcription.py: Added detailed transcription logging
      - jobs.py: Added job creation and cleanup logging

  The implementation follows your requirements exactly:
   - Logs all requests in a web-like style (Request, agent, status, duration)
   - Adds environment variable LOG_LEVEL support
   - When set to "debug", logs full input and output details
   - When "debug" is set, logs which S3 file is being processed

  All changes have been made consistently across the codebase to ensure comprehensive logging. The service will now provide much more detailed information
  for troubleshooting and monitoring purposes.

I've successfully committed the changes to fix the documentation issue with the /transcribe path prefix. Here's a summary of what was done:

  Problem
  When the service was accessed through a load balancer that adds a /transcribe prefix to all routes, the OpenAPI documentation endpoints (/openapi.json,
  /docs, /redoc) were not accessible due to incorrect path resolution.

  Solution
  I made the following changes to fix the issue:

   1. Updated `src/main.py`: Modified FastAPI configuration to properly handle root path prefixes for documentation endpoints
   2. Added `ROOT_PATH` to `src/config.py`: Added configuration variable for the path prefix
   3. Updated `Dockerfile`: Ensured proper environment variable handling
   4. Modified `nomad/video-transcription.hcl`: Added ROOT_PATH environment variable set to /transcribe
   5. Enhanced `README.md`: Added documentation about the fix and the URLs where documentation will be accessible

  Result
  The documentation endpoints are now accessible at:
   - http://fabio.service.consul:9999/transcribe/docs
   - http://fabio.service.consul:9999/transcribe/redoc
   - http://fabio.service.consul:9999/transcribe/openapi.json

  The solution is backward compatible and will work both when the service is accessed directly and when it's accessed through a load balancer with path
  prefixes. The changes have been committed with a descriptive commit message explaining the problem and solution.
